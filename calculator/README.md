# ➕ Simple Python Calculator (CLI)

This is a basic calculator I built in Python as part of my beginner portfolio.

It lets users:
- Add two numbers
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Divide

I created this app early on in my learning to get hands-on practice with functions, user input, and basic Python logic.
