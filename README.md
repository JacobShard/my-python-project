# My Python Project
# üßÆ My First Python Calculator

This is a basic calculator I built while learning Python. It runs in the terminal and lets the user perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

I created this as part of my learning journey to get more confident with writing code from scratch and understanding how Python works.
