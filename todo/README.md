# üìù Simple Python To-Do List (CLI)

This is a command-line to-do list app I built while learning Python.

It lets you:
- View your current tasks
- Add new ones
- Remove tasks you've completed

The tasks are saved to a `tasks.txt` file so they persist between sessions.

I used this as a learning project while building my Python portfolio, with a bit of guidance along the way. Proud to say I understand how it all works under the hood!

2. Navigate to the `todo` folder in your terminal.
