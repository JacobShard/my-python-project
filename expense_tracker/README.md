# ðŸ’¸ Personal Expense Tracker (Python CLI)

This is a simple command-line app that lets users track personal expenses.  
It allows adding new expense records, viewing past entries, filtering by category or date, and calculating total spending.

Expenses are saved in a CSV file (`expenses.csv`) to ensure data is retained across sessions.

## ðŸ¤– Built with AI Guidance

This project was built as part of my journey learning Python.  
While I wrote and structured the code myself, I used **ChatGPT as a learning assistant** to:

- Understand Python syntax and functions  
- Troubleshoot errors step-by-step  
- Improve code structure and readability  
- Gradually build new features like filters and charts

I believe learning to use AI as a tool â€” not a crutch â€” is an important part of being a modern developer. This was a hands-on way to apply that approach.

## ðŸŒ± Next Steps

- Add ability to export data to Excel
- Track budgets per category
- Add monthly breakdown view
